# Advent of Code 2015 Prolog

This repo is me learning Prolog (using SWI-Prolog implementation) and doing puzzles.

Note: these are not necessarily meant to be taken as idiomatic or "good" Prolog code.

# Running

Example:
Start Prolog with `swipl day1.pl` and then type `part1(Answer).Â´ to the prompt.
